XLSfile is free and you can modify it as long as this header 
and its copyright text is intact.  
If you make a modification, please notify me. 

1. Target platforms
===================
Delphi 3.0 
I never tested it in other version.

2. Description
===================
Write directly to simple XLS file format (BIFF5). 
It fast because it doesn't need OLE, DDE, or event M$-Excel.
XLSfile can be used for write raw data, and OLE/DDE to
format it. See demoXlsFile for example (you need to install
this component first) 

Features: 
(very limited because I don't have complete XLS's file-format manual :-(
- worksheet only (no workbook).
- Cell format: thin border, simple shading and allignment
 

3. Installation
===============
Component -> Install component -> choose XLSfile.pas
