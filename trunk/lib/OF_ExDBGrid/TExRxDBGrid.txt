               DataLink, ColCount, RowCount, ColWidths, GridLineWidth,
               InplaceEdit, TitleOffset, OnColumnResize, OptWidth (making the
               'Grid' automatically size itself so that no white space is left
               at the right), VisibleRowCount, VisibleColCount, GridHeight,
               GridWidth, LeftCol, ExportGrid, ExportToFile, GridPreview,
               DataSetPreview, GridPrint, DataSetPrint, SaveToRegistry,
               LoadFromRegistry, CopyToClipboard, CutToClipboard,
               PasteFromClipboard, ShowCustomizeDialog, ShowQueryByForm
               and ShowSortByForm.

               It has the following new Published Properties:
               ScrollBars, EditColor, DefaultRowHeight, RowSizingAllowed,
               DisplayImages, DisplayMemo, DisplayBoolean, GridAutoSize
               (making the columns automatically resize so that they are as wide
               as the row with the widest entry), GridAutoWidth (making the
               columns automatically resize so that no white space is left at
               the right), GridAutoWidthResize, FullSizeMemo, Cells3D
               (when False, the Grid has a Flat look and feel - also the 3D
               Cells can be any color), CellHints (when True and Columns are not
               wide enough for the DisplayText, moving the mouse over a cell
               shows the text in a hint window), RowColor1, RowColor2,
               UseRowColors (using the properties RowColor1 and RowColor2),
               MultiLineTitles, TitleCheck (which places a marker in the top
               left of the grid and enables the grid popup menu when clicked),
               BackgroundPicture, UseBackgroundPicture, ExportDelimiter,
               AllowAutoAppend, DrawFocusRect, EnterAsTab, HighlightColor,
               ImageHighlightColor, HighlightFontColor, ReportCaption, HotTrack,
               HotTrackColor, LockedCols, LockedFont, LockedColor, FlatCheckBox,
               FlatCheckBoxType, MemoViewType, RegistrySaveName,
               ShowTextEllipsis, ShowTitleEllipsis, MultiLineRows, LinesPerRow,
               DisplayDateTime, SearchMode (when True, clicking on the column
               titles will display a search box for the column - Case Sensitive),
               ExMenuOptions, ScrollHints, UseBitmapDrawing (if active, a
               temporary bitmap is used to draw cells within the grid - it
               decreases flickers but draws a cell a bit slowly),
               MemoInplaceEditor, DisplayPopupEditors (when False, memos can
               be edited inplace by single clicking the cell), MaskedColumnDrag,
               ShowTitlesWhenInactive, BoldTitlesWhenCells3D,
               BoldIndicatorsWhenCells3D, Controls, ExtendedScroll, ValueChecked,
               and ValueUnChecked.

               It has the following new Methods:
               MoveToRow and CellRect (which is extremely useful if you want to
               drop other controls on the grid i.e. pop a dropdown list over a
               cell when the user enters it).

               It has the following new Events:
               OnColumnResize, OnMouseDown, OnMouseUp, OnMouseMove, OnColEnter,
               OnRightClick, OnApplyCellAttribute (useful when you want to
               change the colour of an individual cell, based on the value in
               that cell or some other particular condition), OnCustomize,
               OnAutoWidthResize and OnIsBooleanField.

               In addition, it also has the following Features:
               Design Time and Run Time viewing of images, including JPEG
               support, Flat look and feel, Grid Printing, Grid Exporting,
               Enhanced Scrollbar Tracking, Selecting and UnSelecting all
               records, Column Customizing, Drag and Drop implementation,
               Automatic Column Sorting (Tables and Queries), QueryByForm and
               SortByForm implementation (For Paradox and dBASE any column names
               specified in the SortByForm procedure must already be indexed.
               For SQL-based tables, the specified columns need not be indexed.)

               It also has built in popup viewers and Inplace Editors for
               Graphic/Memo/RichEdit and Date/Time Fields. To use these and the
               Checkbox, simply click on the Fields or use the Spacebar, F2 or
               Enter Keys.

*PLEASE NOTE*  Before making any bug reports please first verify you are

               you do report a bug, please, if applicable, include a code
               sample.

               Any suggested enhancements would also be appreciated.

Notes:         I cannot support modified versions of this code. So if you
               encounter a possible bug while using a modified version,
               always first revert back to the original code before making
               an attempt to contact me.
